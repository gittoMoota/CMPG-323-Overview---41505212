## **BRANCHING STRATEGY**
Each project will follow the Git branching strategy where a branch starts on the default branch, which is the main branch. The branch grows a separate history chain as commits are added. Eventually, these commits merge into the main branch. The ultimate goal is to let developers do what they need to do without stepping on one another and to end up with a main branch that represents the best efforts of everyone involved. When working on a branch to add a new feature or fix a bug, you can use the git merge command to merge that work into the default branch.

## **.gitignore file WITHIN THE PROJECTS**
A .gitignore file created in the root directory of each project's repository tells Git which files and directories to ignore at runtime. To share ignore rules with others who block your repository, upload a .gitignore file to your repository. GitHub maintains an official list of recommended .gitignore files for many popular operating systems, environments, and languages ​​in the public repository "GitHub/gitignore". You can also use gitignore.io to create .gitignore files for your operating system, programming language, or IDE. You can tell Git to ignore certain files or directories when you access a Git repository on your computer. This feature allows you to ignore temporary attachment files created by text editors.

## **STORAGE OF CREDENTIALS & SENSITIVE INFO** ##
 Secrets and variables allow you to manage reusable configuration data. Secrets are encrypted and are used for sensitive data. Variables are shown as plain text and are used for non-sensitive data. Anyone with collaborator access to this repository can use these secrets and variables for actions. They are not passed to workflows that are triggered by a pull request from a fork.
